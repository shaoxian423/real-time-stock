# Real-Time Stock Tracker

## Introduction
The **Real-Time Stock Tracker** is a web application that allows users to monitor stock prices in real time and visualize historical price data with candlestick charts. It was originally developed to demonstrate real-time data tracking using WebSockets and chart visualization.

With this tool, you can:
- Subscribe to live stock price updates
- View a list of subscribed stocks with their latest prices
- Display a stock’s price history in a **candlestick (K-line) chart**

The application fetches stock data from the **Yahoo Finance API** and provides an interactive front-end interface for ease of use.

### 📌 Front-End (Client)
- **index.html**: User interface with **input fields, buttons, stock table, and chart**.
- **client.js**:
  - Manages **WebSocket connections**.
  - Sends **subscribe requests** to the server.
  - Updates the **stock table dynamically**.
  - Renders **candlestick charts using Chart.js**.

### 🖥️ Back-End (Server)
- **server.js**:
  - Listens for **WebSocket connections** on `ws://localhost:8080`.
  - Handles **stock subscription requests**.
  - Fetches **real-time prices and historical data** from Yahoo Finance.

## Example Workflow

1️⃣ **User opens the app** and enters a stock symbol (`AAPL`), clicks **Subscribe**. The **table updates** with Apple’s real-time price.

2️⃣ User enters another symbol (`TSLA`), clicks **Subscribe**. The table now shows both **AAPL** and **TSLA**.

3️⃣ User clicks **View K-line Chart** for `AAPL`. A **candlestick chart** appears, showing the past **one month’s** stock history.

4️⃣ User removes `TSLA` from tracking by clicking **red “X”**, and `TSLA` disappears from the table.

## Future Enhancements 🚀
- **Continuous real-time price updates** (via WebSocket push instead of polling).
- **Database integration** to store user subscriptions.
- **Extended historical data ranges** for candlestick charts.
- **User authentication** to save watchlists.

## Conclusion
The **Real-Time Stock Tracker** is a demonstration of **real-time WebSockets, financial data visualization, and interactive stock monitoring**. Users can subscribe to live prices, view **K-line charts**, and manage their watchlist seamlessly.

✅ **Real-time WebSocket updates**
